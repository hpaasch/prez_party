This project is deployed at http://www.presidentialdinnerparty.com/

This is my final project for the Backend Engineering with Python & Django bootcamp.
Design assistance from a front-end student, in exchange for me providing the
database and API endpoints for her project.

The concept is based on a need for people to have more fact-based conversations
about important subjects, such as who is running for president. Given how common
it is for people to avoid such conversations, this application provides an
inviting structure.

A person creates an account, and creates as many dinner parties as they want to
host. In real life, the person invites friends over. In the app, the person
invites a commentator and a candidate. The app then guides the party host and
their guests through a discussion. It ends with a survey, which the party host
keeps.

The project uses the Twitter API and uses a ProPublica API of Federal Elections
Commission data. The project stores tweets and campaign finance info in a database,
and performs additional calculations on that data.



Project meets the official course requirements:
1. Include a web application written in Python/Django.
2. Use data stored in a database.
3. Integrate with at least one "outside" data store or API.
4. Be useful in some way, not just a direct clone of something that already
exists. Add value or a niche to an existing application.
5. Use at least one technology or package not covered in class.
6. Integrate a form of image upload and storage.
7. Be achievable in the three-week project period.
8. Have code available in github.
9. Be deployed on the public Internet, with a service like Heroku.
